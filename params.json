However, for more control, you can talk to the RedEdge by serial port, Ethernet, or Wifi. \r\n\r\nAPI documentation is organized by the camera firmware version it describes. We'll always do our best to **not** break anything with new releases, but sometimes new features may be released that were not present in older software versions, so it is always best to check your firmware version and read the appropriate version. Of course, you can always upgrade your camera to the latest firmware! Log on to the MicaSense portal or contact us for the latest. \r\n\r\n**Don't know what version you have?** Connect to the camera Wifi, and you can read the version from the bottom of the 'config' page. \r\n\r\n### HTTP API Documentation\r\n\r\nThe HTTP API is the most powerful way to interface to the RedEdge. You can use this API using either the Ethernet connector or the Wifi access point. \r\n\r\n#### v1.3.2\r\n\r\n[HTTP API Documentation for v1.3.2](API_1.3.2.html)\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-50862965-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
